                    <h2> Reading books can be said to be my hobby. But I don't see it as one. It's not a hobby if you are doing it all the time, not just your free time. Of all of books I enjoy fantasy novels most of all, but now I'm enjoying scientific ones too. Many people see reading as something you're forced to do, but with the right book, it is a great enjoyment.</h2>
